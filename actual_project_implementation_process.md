In a real-world production environment, the data to be queried is stored in a database, which can be accessed in Python by providing the database connection parameters and credentials. Many databases also support connections via APIs.

There are multiple ways to run SQL scripts in Python, depending on the database, setup, and requirements. If there are multiple scripts, we can compile them in a file or folder and iterate through them in Python to execute each query.

Depending on the requirement, the result sets can be saved in different formatsâ€”written to a new database table, saved as flat files, or uploaded to folders or repositories. The output files can also be sent as email attachments.

This entire process can be automated and scheduled to run at defined intervals, making data delivery consistent and efficient.
